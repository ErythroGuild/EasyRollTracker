Easy Roll Tracker
---

A lightweight addon to list `/roll` results in a raid,
with many convenience features. Open the tracking window
with `/rt` or `/rolltrack`.

**Feedback, suggestions, and criticism are welcome!**
Open a [new GitHub issue][5] for the fastest response,
but comments in other places will get to me eventually.

## Major features

- Listing and sorting all `/roll` results in group
- Tracking the number rolled out of
- Announcing loot rolls to group as `/rw`

## Commands

*These can be opened with any of the addon aliases:*
*`/rt`, `/rolltrack`, or `/erolltracker`.*

- `/rt`: opens main window
- `/rt config`: opens the settings window (`opt` and `options` work as well)
- `/rt close`: closes the current roll
- `/rt clear`: clears the main window

## Minor features
